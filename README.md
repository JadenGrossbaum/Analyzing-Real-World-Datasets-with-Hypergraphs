Analyzing Real-World Datasets with Hypergraphs
This project explores the application of hypergraph analysis on diverse real-world datasets, including healthcare, retail, and education. By leveraging hypergraphs, the project examines complex relationships between entities, identifies patterns through degree distributions, and highlights key insights using logarithmic scaling to uncover power-law behaviors. The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of network structures and their implications across different domains.
